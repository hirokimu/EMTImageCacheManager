#EMTImageCacheManager
An image cache manager for WKInterfaceDevice of Apple WatchKit (watchOS 1)

##How it works
If you add a data to the cache via EMTImageCacheManager, the cache is automatically named its name as below.
```objective-c
cache<current date>_<image name>
```
Then, if WKInterfaceDevice's cachedImages is already full, EMTImageCacheManager removes cache files as much as necessary in ascending order by added date.


## Installation

Simply add class files to your project, or use CocoaPods.

### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, "8.2"
target :'Your WatchKit Extension Name', :exclusive => true do
    pod 'EMTImageCacheManager', '~> 1.0.0'
end
```

## Usage

### Initialization

EMTImageCacheManager is a singleton class. Get instance via the instance method.

All data named by EMTImageCacheManager will be extracted from caches automatically when you try to add/get/remove a cache via the class at first.
If you want to do that process in your timing, use a following method.

```objective-c
[[EMTImageCacheManager instance] prepareOrderedCacheInformations];
```

### Add a image data to cache

```objective-c
NSString *imageName = [[EMTImageCacheManager instance] addOrderedCachedImageWithData:data name:@"image01"];
if (imageName) {
    //Cache succeeded. You can handle a image with the returned imageName.
    [self.thumbImage setImageNamed:imageName];
}
else {
    //Cache is full with non-EMTImageCacheManager images.
    [self.thumbImage setImageData:data];
}
```

### Retrieve the imageName of cached image data

```objective-c
NSString *imageName = [[EMTImageCacheManager instance] getOrderedCacheKeyForName:@"image01"];
if (imageName) {
    //Cache found
    [self.thumbImage setImageNamed:imageName];
}
```

### Remove cached images

```objective-c
//Remove a single file added via EMTImageCacheManager
[[EMTImageCacheManager instance] removeOrderedCachedImageForName:@"image01"];

//Remove all files added via EMTImageCacheManager
[[EMTImageCacheManager instance] removeAllOrderedCachedImage];
```
